CYLO — Read Anything (Offline, One-File)
Updated index.html (renders HTML/XML via iframe) + iPad icon support.

Files:
- index.html
- icon.png

How to deploy on GitHub Pages:
1) Create a public repo (or open your repo).
2) Upload BOTH files (index.html and icon.png) at the repo root.
3) Settings → Pages → Source: main branch, /(root) → Save.
4) Wait ~1 minute, open the green link.

How to add to iPad Home Screen:
1) Open your Pages URL in Safari.
2) Share → Add to Home Screen.
3) The icon uses icon.png (180×180).

Use:
- Tap “Choose Files” and select any TXT/MD/JSON/CSV/HTML/XML/PNG/JPG/GIF/WEBP/HEIC/PDF.
- HTML/XML now render inside an iframe instead of showing source.
- “Save Capsule Snapshot” stores a local counter in your device (no upload).

— Prepared for CYLO at Toronto time.
